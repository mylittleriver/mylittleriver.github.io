Hi there - My name is Shujun Xia, and I also go by Erin. I'm currently a third year undergrad majoring in CS at Columbia University. Previously, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Antoni Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/) on explainable AI for computer vision. I have also worked on Continual Learning and Knowledge Editing in LLMs with two first-authored papers under review. My current research interests lie in Multimodal Understanding and Learning. Collaborations of all kinds are always welcome!

## üì£ News 
- [2025/09] Awarded the ICCV Broadening Participation Travel Grant. See you in Hawaii!
- [2025/07] My first paper accepted to **eXCV@ICCV 2025**!
